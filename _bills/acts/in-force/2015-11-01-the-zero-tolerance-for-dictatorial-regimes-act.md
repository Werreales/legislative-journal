# Article I - Defining Dictatorships

A Dictatorship is a Nation that openly commits human rights abuses toward their people. Dictatorships may have state controlled media. While they can control the peopleâ€™s ability to act and vote in some levels, they must allow some ability to have a minimum of limited democracy, freedom to spend economically, and freedom to act as the people wish in regard to their own person.

# Article II - The Law

While Nations can come into the Region as Dictatorships, they must be able to make progress to some level of democracy, as stated above. Starting January 1st, 2016, any new nation that comes into the Region that is identified as a Dictatorship must be registered with the Minister of Defense. The Minister of Defense will be tasked with watching the dictatorships and must be able to see marked improvements in the dictatorships they are monitoring. A suspected new Dictatorship will have one month of monitoring to show progress in the human rights, with a standard of Good or better. Should progress not be made within a month, and the dictatorship continue their practices, they will be allowed to be ejected from the Region. This law will not impact any dictatorships that currently exist in the Region prior to January 1st, 2016.

# Article III - Enactment
This Law shall be enacted on January 1st, 2016 at 12:00 AM, should a majority of active Nations support it.
