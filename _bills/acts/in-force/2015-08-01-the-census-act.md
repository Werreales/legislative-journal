# Article I - Creation of the Regional Census

This Act creates the first Regional Census. The Census will be managed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who will have the task of determining an official population count for the Region. The population will be determined by using the main pages of the nations. This count will not include puppet states within the Region. The census must be tabulated by the first of the month following the month of enacting as determined by the Government, who can call a census when it is deemed required.

# Article II - Creation of the Standard Tax Rate

This Act creates a Standard Tax Rate, to be managed by the Ministry of Finance. The Standard Tax Rate will be called STR for the remaining of this Act. STR is determined by the total amount of tax rate within the Region divided by the number of states within the Region. Puppets will not pay a rate, as they do not technically exist. STR is allowed to fluctuate and encourages more nations in the Region, as the rate decreases the more non puppet nations are in the Region. Therefore the Ministry of Immigration will play the role of encouraging immigration to drive down the rate. The STR will also determine the first and all future budgets within the Region. Every nation in the Region (with the exception of puppets) will pay the STR. It will only be paid once every census.

# Article III - Representation In The NWU Legislature

Representation within the NWU Legislature will be determined by population of the nations in the Region. A Nation will receive 1 seat in the Legislature for every 50 Million people within their nation. All members of the Region will be named automatically a member of this Legislature, with the exception of puppets, which wonâ€™t have representation.

# Article IV - Activation and Ratification

This Act will be ratified by 51% of the active nations voting yes on the measure. Once ratified, it will come into effect and the census collection will begin.
