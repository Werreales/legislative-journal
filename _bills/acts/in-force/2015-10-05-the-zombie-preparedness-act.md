# Article I - Regional Protectionary Procedure

The Region shall protect itself from the threat. Immediately after the notification comes out about the event, the Region will shut down all Regional borders. The Region will be placed on immediate Category 5 standing of the New World Union Threat Category System, the highest and most threatening standard. Category 5 rank states that "the most severe cases require this. Severe cases include Z-Day and other such events".

The Founder or Delegate will place a password on the Region to set the border. The password will not be known except by a select few nations. The password shall not be lifted for 48 hours after the event ends.

The following sections will address the protocol for each option listed in the event.

# Article II - Curing Protocol

Production of the Cure is one of the two accepted national responses for the event, the other being Military Intervention. Nations that produce the cure are expected to come together as the Zombie Cure Response Team (ZCRT). All nations in ZCRT are asked to continue producing the cure throughout the event. Once the cure is officially created, members of that team will be firing missiles throughout the Region, helping all they can to reduce the disease.

# Article III - Zombieland: When A Nation Decides To Join The Horde

Zombieland is not an accepted choice. The two sections in this article state what the Regional and National Responses will be to Zombieland.

## Section I - Regional Response

Nations that choose Zombieland (Join the Horde) will lose control of their Government within the Region. All pending National Elections will be suspended, reinstated once the event ends. Nations that have produced the cure will go into action, firing cure missiles into the Zombie Nations. They will control the Government of the Zombie Nation during the event, restoring control of the Government to the former Zombie Nation.

## Section II - National Response

Nations that share borders with Zombie swarmed nations are directed to shut their borders until the event ends and the Zombies are confirmed to be struck down. All treaties between those Nations will be suspended, and all trading practices will be shut down until the event ends.

# Article IV - Enactment Procedure

This Act shall be enacted beginning as soon as the Regional Borders are closed for the event.
