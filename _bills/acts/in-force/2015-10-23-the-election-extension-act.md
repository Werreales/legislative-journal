title: The Election Extension Act
desc: This Act comes in the wake of Edaxia's hospitalization due to appendix issues, though it has been in consideration since the first activation of an Acting Delegate during Unovia's 2nd Term, December 2014. It will cover what this act is designed to do, the procedure for activation, and finally put a standard for ratification.

# Article I

As the Regional election law stands now, a term for Delegate is approximately 90 Days. This Act will legally extend the term for Delegate, should it be needed. The extension period will be equivalent to the number of days away from the office plus one. These days will be attached to the end of the term in which a sitting Delegate is currently serving. Should that Delegate sit for any successive terms, the number of days will be reset to 90 Days for that term, unless another necessary extension occurs.

# Article II - Procedure for Activation

To activate this Act, someone in the Government must have news of an unforeseen issue, such as medical leave (in Edaxia's case), or other occurrence where the current Delegate will be away from the Region for an either known or unknown period of time, such as vacations where internet is not accessible, medical issues, or other such situation. Once it is confirmed and stated on the RMB, this Act begins to take effect. Acting Delegates are to be named by either the Founder (should the amount of Delegate absence not be known) or the current Delegate (should the amount of absence be known). The Acting Delegates shall serve in the Delegate's stead until the current Delegate either returns or Ceases to Exist. In the case of a Delegate Ceasing to Exist, a new Delegate is named, presumably from the Acting Delegates. The new Delegate shall serve out the remainder of the term, being eligible for election in their own right should they desire to run.

# Article III - Ratification of the Measure

This Act shall be enacted once a majority of the active nations vote for the measure.
