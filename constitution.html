	    <h2>Preamble</h2>
	    <p>The New World Union is a Region that accepts all Nations, regardless of ideology. We are dedicated to the proposition that all Nations will have an equal and respected voice, regardless of how large or small, they are. We are also dedicated to the proposition that one Nation does not always have the ideas alone and that we must move forward lockstep together, in a strong bond that will weather any potential crisis we may face. The Region shall be balanced on the pillars of Democracy, Equality, Freedom, and Justice.</p>

	    <p>The regional justice system will transfer half responsibility to the Court of International Law and Justice. The 'Court of International Law and Justice - CILJ' is an Inter-Regional Court which, in most instances, hears the cases of Region, Nations and Inter-Regional Agreements which have elected to become members of the Court which involve recognizing its Jurisdiction without compromise and agreeing to abide by its rulings unreservedly. This will only be used if the situation can not be handled within the region or the plaintiff takes the case directly to court, in which case a formal complaint must be made and an official request for case must be made to the court. The region will be a member of the following chambers; Chamber of Original Jurisdiction and Chamber of Inter-Regional Affairs. Any and all appeals will be handled in house by the regional court. The regional court will now handle the reviewing of laws passed by the senate and signed by the delegate, handle sentencing and to determine whether to case should head to court or not. If they decide not, it will be mediated by a member of the founders' council.</p>
